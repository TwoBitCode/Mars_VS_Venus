## 🧠 Game Overview
*Mars vs Venus: The Battle of Minds* places players in a fictional world where men (Mars) and women (Venus) are portrayed as distinct beings with unique mentalities, emotions, and perspectives.

The game emphasizes relationship management and showcases differences in communication and thinking patterns between genders. Throughout the journey, players encounter diverse scenarios, making decisions that require them to choose between a "Mars" or "Venus" approach, ultimately fostering mutual understanding and effective communication between genders.
