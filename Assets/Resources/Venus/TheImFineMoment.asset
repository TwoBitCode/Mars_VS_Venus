  description: "Scenario:\nYour partner says, \u201CI\u2019m fine,\u201D but you
    can tell he\u2019s upset. He\u2019s been quiet and distant.\n"
  choices:
  - '"Keep pressing him until he tells you what''s wrong."'
  - '"Give him space, but check in later."'
  - "\"Let him be and don\u2019t say anything more.\""

    shows you care without pressuring him.
  falseFeedback: "Pressing too hard can make him shut down. It\u2019s better to give
    him space and gently offer support later."
